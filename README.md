# Sunflower Land Level Calculator

A simple tool that helps players calculate their level in **Sunflower Land** based on their current XP (experience points) and track progress toward the next level.

---

## Features

- Enter your current **XP** to get your **current level**
- See **XP needed** for the next level
- Visualize your **progress percentage**
- Bonus: Add estimated XP gains from farming activities (optional)

---

## Why Use This?

Leveling in *Sunflower Land* can take a while, especially if you're managing your crops, animals, and tasks manually. This calculator lets you:

- Quickly see where you are
- Know how much XP you need
- Optimize what to focus on next

---

## How It Works

- The calculator uses official XP requirements per level from Sunflower Land.
- You input your **current XP**, and the tool:
  - Determines your **current level**
  - Shows how much XP you need to level up
  - Displays a **progress bar** based on your current XP

### Example:
If you're at `260 XP`, and:
- Level 3 starts at 200 XP
- Level 4 starts at 400 XP

You are:
- On **Level 3**
- **140 XP away** from Level 4
- **30% through** Level 3
